Give reasons for the answers. Ans. (i) The sentence “Rani is a beautiful girl” is not a statement. To some Rani may look beautiful and to other she may not look beautiful. We cannot say on logic whether or not this sentence is true. (ii) The sentence ‘shut the door’ is not a statement. It is only an imperative sentence giving a direction to someone. There is no question of it being true or false. (iii) The sentence ‘yesterday was Friday’ is not a statement. It is an ambiguous sentence which is true if spoken on Saturday and false if spoken on other days. Truth or false hood of the sentence depends on the time at which it is spoken and not on mathematical reasoning. 2.

The given statements are is true for every real number and There exists real numbers and for which These statements are not negations of each other as they can be true at the same time. Infact, negation of p is There are real numbers and for which Note that p is always true whatever and may be and is always false. 5. Write the contra-positive and converse of the following statements. (i) If is a prime number, then is odd. (ii) if the two lines are parallel, then they do not intersect in the same plane. Ans. If statement is then its contra-positive is and its converse is 2 ","(i) Contra-positive : “If is not odd, then is not a prime number.” Converse : “If is odd, then is a prime number.” (ii) Contra-positive : “If two lines intersect in the same plane, then they are not parallel.” Converse: “If two lines do not intersect in the same plane, then they are parallel.” 6. Show that the statement P : “If is a real number such that then is 0” is true by (i) direct method, (ii) method of contradiction, (iii) method of contra-positive Ans. Given statement is p: “If is a real number such that then (i) Direct method: Let Note that if the product of two numbers is zero then atleast one of them is surely zero.

There are three mutually exclusive and exhaustive events and . The odds are 8 : 3 against and 2 : 5 in favors of find the odd against . Ans. Odds against E 1 are 8:3 So odds in favors of E 1 are 3:8 Odds against are 15 ","16. If an entrance test that is graded on the basis of two examinations, the probability of a randomly chosen student passing the first examination is 0.8 and the probability of passing the second examination is 0.7. The probability of passing at least one of them is 0.95. What is the probability of passing both? Ans. A : student passes first examination B : student passes Second examination P (A) = 0.8, P (B) = 0.7 P (A B) = 0.95 P (A B) =? P (A B) = P (A) + P (B) - P (A B) 0.95 = 0.8 + 0.7 - P (A B) 0.55 = P (A B). 17. One card is drawn from a well shuffled deck of 52 cards.
